The project scrapes the data from coursera.org

Clone the project
``` git clone https://github.com/NischalBhandari/scraping-project.git```


then 
```npm install```
 
then run 
```npm run start:dev``` 


this will open up a page where you can search by inputting in a field this will give you the link to the csv file but it may not be available just after submitting request as it will take some time to scrape so you can check after some time if the file is there.
